# THEORIES-OF-DEBATES-IN-PARLIAMENT

As part of the Multivariate Analysis course, I wrote a paper about the effect of participation of Members of Parliemant to the debates in different electoral regimes.

Debating and voting are the most important activities of members serving in democratically elected parties. The purpose of this project to examine the effect of the participation of Members of Parliamentary debates in different electoral regimes, by testing two hypothesis related with ideological distances.

Hypothesis 1: In majoritarian systems, the larger the distance between MP’s ideological logical position to the party, the more speeches the MP delivers in the paliament
Hypothesis 2: In proportional systems, the larger the distance between MP’s ideological logical position to the party, the fewer speeches the MP delivers in the paliament

In order to test these two hypothesis, two different datasets are used, that represents Germany and England. For simplicity, U.K. assumed to have proportional regime whereas Germany assumed to have majoritarian regime, even though in Germany different electoral vote systems are present for list and district MP’s.

To test the hypothesis for majoritarian systems, a simulation is made on party level on UK dataset and was found that the larger the distance between MP’s ideological position to the party, the more speeches the MP delivers in the parlaiment regardless of the party, therefore hypothesis is accepted. In Germany, the hypothesis about proportional systems is tested with a simulation on party level, and it was found that the larger the distance between MP’s ideological position to the party, the fewer speeches MP delivers in parlaiment, this effect held on party level, therefore hypothesis 2 is accepted. In order to explain the differences more, several first difference and simulations are done, details can be found in the paper.
