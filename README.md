# THEORIES-OF-DEBATES-IN-PARLIAMENT

As part of the Multivariate Analysis course that I have taken in the first semester, 


Debating and voting are the most important activities of members serving in democratically elected parties. The purpose of this project to examine the effect of the participation of Members of Parliamentary debates in different electoral regimes, by testing two hypothesis related with ideological distances.

Hypothesis 1: In majoritarian systems, the larger the distance between MP’s ideological logical position to the party, the more speeches the MP delivers in the paliament
Hypothesis 2: In proportional systems, the larger the distance between MP’s ideological logical position to the party, the fewer speeches the MP delivers in the paliament

In order to test these two hypothesis, two different datasets are used, that represents Germany and England. For simplicity, U.K. assumed to have proportional regime whereas Germany assumed to have majoritarian regime, even though in Germany different electoral vote systems are present for list and district MP’s.
